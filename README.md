# nexpay-demo

This project is built as a tech demo for NexPay code challenge interview. It features a foreign exchange (FX) platform where users can create contracts selecting which currency they want to convert from and to. The exchange rate is calculated and provided by an FX API. The PaymentAPI receives the contract requests, saves them, and checks if they are completed.
